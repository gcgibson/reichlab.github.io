Cluster-randomized trials are a type of clinical trial where clusters of individuals are randomized instead of individuals. In our work on several high-profile cluster-randomized clinical trials -- including the ResPECT Study (funded by CDC and VA), the SCRUB Trial, and a telehealth collaborative care trial for HIV patients (funded by VA) -- we have developed simulation methods for calculating power for cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trials. These methods are available as an R software package, clusterPower.
