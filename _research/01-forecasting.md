Our team is working to develop statistical methods and tools that can improve
real-time infectious disease forecasting efforts for a variety of diseases,
including [dengue fever](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004761) 
and [influenza](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10936). We focus on building robust 
and interpretable models that can be used by public health officials to drive 
policy decisions. For example, in a collaboration with the Ministry of Public 
Health in Thailand, our team has built statistical forecast models to predict 
outbreaks of dengue fever in real-time since early 2014 for each of the 77 
provinces in Thailand. From a methodological perspective we work on developing 
ensemble methodology (fusing together forecasts from multiple models) and on 
forecasting methods that can account for reporting delays in surveillance data.
