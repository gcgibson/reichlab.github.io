  - title: Inference with Particle Filtering
    description: We are using particle filtering to fit complex models of disease transmission to better estimate parameters governing pathogen interactions, e.g. cross-protection or enhancement between dengue serotypes.

In multi-pathogen infectious disease systems, complex immunological interactions between multiple strains of disease govern the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of disease. Understanding these interactions plays a vital role in clinical and public health decision-making. Our work combines multiple data streams from complex disease systems with modern statistical and computational methodologies to find evidence of complex interactions within the system. For example, our research was the first to use population-level data to explicitly estimate the duration of temporary immunity experienced by individuals after an infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue fever.
